# TO DO


- Fix system prompt to actually include AGENTS.md, render workspace info, add datetime
- Fix prompt_id being hard coded, actually use hash of unrendered
- Add /model selection in ACP
- ~~Include @-ed files in the context through /files or whatever~~
- Add tool calls and executions token emission
- Add callbacks points to agent
- create contracts for requests and responses from callbacks extension SDK so other packages that import crow-acp can interact with the code without inheritance, self injection, or circular imports by
  1.  exposing get/set methods on session data
  2. expose `session/new` and `session/initialize` methods so extension can create new session with new data
  3. expose `session/prompt` with method so extensions/callbacks can use agent's warm kv cache for fast summarization during compaction
- Use AsyncOpenAI client to enable better `session/cancel` behavior
- Load persisted agent from disk using local model. make sure the kv cache is exactly the same

# IDEA 
Just sit down with [agentclientprotocol.com](https://agentclientprotocol.com) and go through the whole thing once just to read, then again with a piece of paper taking notes, then again slower actually implementing in crow-acp.

Pretty much everything I want to do is in here. 

So I added the resource_link blocks to the context and added a `context_fetcher` function to fetch the content of a file and return it as a string.

but yeah I can now chat with an agent in a persistent file and then just copy and paste the conversation into the chat. This is ideal. I mean honestly I think this is going to change how I use the agent.


Think I should have the agent make a PLAN.md and iterate, or do I want to do this by hand and have the agent assist me the way it did when I was creating

Nah I think I just need to do this by hand. Ask the agent as a super sophisticated search engine and debugger to hep me work.


but yeah I think the thing I need to do is to create a bunch of examples of what I want to do in the sandbox and have the echo agent just get progressively more sophisticated. Slash commands, skills, the works, all disconnected from the agent for development velocity.




okay we've got [async-react](./sandbox/async-react/README.md) set up and a plan for how to do cancellations on a more simplified level. Seems we need to append an AsyncEvent to each session to allow for the session/cancel update to kill everything and the idea is that since we're using AsyncOpenAI now it will trace all the way back to the provider and end session in a way that we can pick up right where we left off.

which is one of the reasons I was thinking about making persistence a callback, because it basically already is a callback and I want to formalize the get/set operations over our session state, which apparently now needs a AsyncEvent attached?

we looked at how kimi-cli does it in refs/kimi-li/src/kimi_cli/acp but they're going to have a very different approach that us because we're using native ACP but still a long to learn from

Yeah cancellation is the real highest priority even moreso than tool calling. Like what good does seeing what the agent is up to do if you can't stop it?
