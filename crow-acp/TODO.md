# TO DO


- Fix system prompt to actually include AGENTS.md, render workspace info, add datetime
- Fix prompt_id being hard coded, actually use hash of unrendered
- Add /model selection in ACP
- ~~Include @-ed files in the context through /files or whatever~~
- Add tool calls and executions token emission
- ~~Use AsyncOpenAI client to enable better `session/cancel` behavior~~
- Load persisted agent from disk using local model. make sure the kv cache is exactly the same

# BACKLOG
- Add callbacks points to agent
- create contracts for requests and responses from callbacks extension SDK so other packages that import crow-acp can interact with the code without inheritance, self injection, or circular imports by
  1.  exposing get/set methods on session data
  2. expose `session/new` and `session/initialize` methods so extension can create new session with new data
  3. expose `session/prompt` with method so extensions/callbacks can use agent's warm kv cache for fast summarization during compaction
- The key insight is that synchronous blocking code (like `time.sleep()` in the terminal polling loop) inside an `async def` function will block the entire event loop - which could cause hangs if the MCP transport needs to do I/O simultaneously. The fix would be `asyncio.to_thread()` or making the polling truly async.




# IDEA 
Just sit down with [agentclientprotocol.com](https://agentclientprotocol.com) and go through the whole thing once just to read, then again with a piece of paper taking notes, then again slower actually implementing in crow-acp.
