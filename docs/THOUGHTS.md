# THOUGHTS

Not sure honestly. So I've got a good bit of code in here already that's been lifted with pretty decent fidelity from my original by-hand example and I'm not unhappy with what I'm looking at so far, which admittedly hasn't been much.


I've sort of let GLM-5 run wild using a very very TDD, research driven approach.

```
UNDERSTAND → DOCUMENT → RESEARCH → TEST → IMPLEMENT → REFACTOR
```

## IDEA

Agent uses lots of search and articulates understanding, the builds constraints based on that understanding, THEN finally engages with the compiler/interpreter in a dialectical approach. Where we let the compiler/interpreter be the ~X to the agent's assumption X and then let LLM resolve contradiction to Y in X + ~X -> Y dialectic


## WHERE WE ARE

-[x] Agent based on ACP  
-[x] Session persistence  
-[x] MCP tools for terminal and file editor taken from openhands
-[ ] Extensions based on callback handlers at different parts of the react loop
